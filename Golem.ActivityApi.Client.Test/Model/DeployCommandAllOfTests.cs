/* 
 * Yagna Activity API
 *
 *  The Activity API can be perceived as controls which a Requestor-side application has to steer the execution of an Activity as specified in an Agreement which has been negotiated via the Market API/Protocol. This defines possible interactions between the Requestor application (via Activity API) and the generic components running on the Provider node, which host the Provider-side application code. The possible interactions imply a logical “execution environment” component, which is the host/container for the “payload” code. The “execution environment” is specified as an ExeUnit, with a generic interface via which a Provider node’s Activity Controller can operate the hosted code. It conforms with capability level 1 of the [Activity API specification] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BXaN32ediXdBHljEApmznSfbuudTU8TmvOmHKl0gmQM).
